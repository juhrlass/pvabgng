# Signup Functionality Implementation

This document provides an overview of the signup functionality implemented in the PVABGNG application.

## Components and Files

### 1. Signup Form Component
- **File**: `src/components/SignupForm.tsx`
- **Description**: Client-side form for user registration
- **Features**:
  - Form fields for name, email, password, and password confirmation
  - Client-side validation for required fields, password matching, and minimum password length
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Redirects to login page with success parameter after successful registration

### 2. Signup API Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`
- **Description**: Server-side API endpoint for user registration
- **Features**:
  - Validates input data (email format, password length)
  - Checks for existing users with the same email
  - Creates a new user with the UserRepository
  - Returns appropriate success or error responses

### 3. Signup Page
- **File**: `src/app/signup/page.tsx`
- **Description**: Page that hosts the signup form
- **Features**:
  - Clean, user-friendly layout
  - Link back to the home page
  - Link to the login page for users who already have an account

### 4. Registration Success Component
- **File**: `src/components/RegistrationSuccess.tsx`
- **Description**: Shows a success message after registration
- **Features**:
  - Appears on the login page when redirected from successful registration
  - Uses URL query parameters to determine when to show

### 5. Navigation Updates
- **Files**:
  - `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
  - `src/app/login/page.tsx`
- **Description**: Updated to include links to the signup page
- **Features**:
  - Signup link in the navbar for non-authenticated users (desktop and mobile views)
  - Signup link on the login page for users who don't have an account

## User Flow

1. User clicks on "Sign Up" in the navbar or on the login page
2. User is taken to the signup page
3. User fills out the registration form
4. Form is validated client-side before submission
5. On submission, the data is sent to the signup API endpoint
6. If successful, user is redirected to the login page with a success message
7. If there's an error, an appropriate error message is displayed on the form

## Testing the Signup Functionality

### Prerequisites
- The application is running
- The database is properly set up and migrations have been applied

### Test Cases

#### 1. Form Validation
- Try submitting the form without filling all fields
- Try submitting with mismatched passwords
- Try submitting with a password shorter than 8 characters
- Each should show an appropriate error message

#### 2. Email Uniqueness
- Try registering with an email that already exists in the database
- Should show an error message about the email being already registered

#### 3. Successful Registration
- Fill out the form with valid data
- Submit the form
- Should be redirected to the login page with a success message
- Should be able to log in with the newly created credentials

#### 4. Navigation Flow
- Check that the signup link appears in the navbar when not logged in
- Check that the signup link appears on the login page
- Check that clicking these links takes you to the signup page

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- Input validation is performed on both client and server sides
- Email uniqueness is enforced to prevent duplicate accounts
- Default role is set to 'user' to ensure proper access control

## Next Steps

1. Add email verification functionality
2. Implement password strength requirements
3. Add CAPTCHA or other anti-bot measures
4. Implement account recovery options
